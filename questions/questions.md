I also read about the company's revenue and growth metrics and other business's commentaries on the work they do here. I made sure this was a place I would belong and wanted to belong. I also, since I work in information security, researched their outlook and buy-in to security to see if my job is an important asset to the company or if I'd be fighting an uphill battle everyday to prove the worth fo the work I do. Security is obviously a top priority for everyone as Zoom, so it was a match made in infosec heaven. Less

- A vulnerability in a web server that exists due to a lack of malicious user input detection, sanitation, and validation checks. SSRF vulnerabilities don't validate the user provided URL endpoints before processing/calling the URL endpoints. This allows a bad-actor to make requests to bogon IP addresses (127.0.0.1, 169.254.0.0/16, fe80::1, etc) which often can force the web server to reveal sensitive data and website administration pages that only run on localhost to a bad-actor on the public internet.
